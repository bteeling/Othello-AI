# Othello-AI
An AI for making legal moves for the board game Othello. 
The program has the capability to play randomly, let the user play manually, or by using the AI to evaluate potential moves to make an intelligent move. 
This was done for a school project and was used to defeat the rest of my classmatesâ€™ programs in a class tournament.
The code that enables two programs to play against each other wasn't written by me, so I've marked sections that i wrote with a long line at the start and another at the end. Some of the variables, the section enabling random, manual, and intelligent play, the methods called by that section, and the first board class are marked indicating I wrote them.
KeyboardInputClass was not written by me but is required for the program to work.
