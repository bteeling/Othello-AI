# Othello-AI
An AI for making legal moves for the board game Othello. 
The program has the capability to play randomly, let the user play manually, or by using the AI to evaluate potential moves to make an intelligent move. 
This was done for a school project and was used to defeat the rest of my classmatesâ€™ programs in a class tournament.
Code I wrote is the only code included here. The code allowing two programs to play against each other is not included as it was written and provided to us by the professor.
